## About Taolend

Taolend is purpose-built for the Bittensor economy, providing a peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platform where lenders create offers and borrowers select offers with the best conditions.

Loans have **no fixed duration**. Loans cannot be collected within the first 3 days after initiation (collection protection period). After this period, lenders are allowed, but not forced, to initiate collection. Interest is calculated **per block**.

Once a loan enters collection, borrowers have a **3-day** collection grace period to repay. Failure to repay within this period results in liquidation and loss of all ALPHA collateral. Borrowers may **Repay** or **Refinance** at any time before liquidation.

> ❗️Important Notice: After the initial 3-day protection period, a loan may enter collection at any time. Borrowers are strongly advised to monitor their loan status closely and pay attention to email notifications to avoid missing critical actions.
