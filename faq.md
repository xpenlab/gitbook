## Platform Basics

### What is Taolend?

Taolend is a peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platform built on the Bittensor EVM chain, designed specifically for lending between TAO and ALPHA tokens:

- **Lenders**: Deposit TAO and create loan Offers to earn interest
- **Borrowers**: Collateralize ALPHA to borrow TAO and access liquidity
- **P2P Matching**: Lenders and borrowers are directly matched through the Offer mechanism

### How does Taolend work?

Taolend operates through a P2P Offer-based matching model:

1. **Lenders Create Offers**
   - Define lending terms such as Amount, Daily APR, and collateral requirements
   - Offers are signed offline
   - Signed Offers are listed publicly in the Market

2. **Borrowers Accept Offers**
   - Browse available Offers in the Market
   - The system automatically matches the Best Daily APR
   - Borrow with one click, and TAO is transferred immediately

3. **P2P Loan Relationships**
   - Each loan has a clearly defined lender and borrower
   - Interest is paid directly to the lender (after a 30% protocol fee)
   - Loans are repaid and managed independently

### Why use Taolend?

**For Lenders**:
- ✅ Earn predictable interest income (Daily APR: 0.01%–1%)
- ✅ Loans are protected by ALPHA collateral (90% safety margin)
- ✅ Create multiple Offers with different terms to diversify risk

**For Borrowers**:
- ✅ Retain long-term exposure to ALPHA
- ✅ Access TAO liquidity for other activities
- ✅ Repay or refinance at any time

### Is Taolend safe to use?

Taolend applies multiple layers of security:

**Security Features**:
- ✅ Funds are managed by audited smart contracts
- ✅ ALPHA collateral protects lenders
- ✅ Transparent and traceable P2P loan structure
- ✅ EIP-712 compliant signature verification

**Risk Warnings**:
- ⚠️ ALPHA price volatility
- ⚠️ Borrower default risk (mitigated by collateral)

**Fees Applied**:
- ✅ **Protocol Fee**: 30% of interest (lenders receive 70%)

## Account and Bridging

### Do I need to register an account?

Yes. Registration is required before using Taolend:

1. **Connect Wallet** (EVM-compatible, e.g. MetaMask)
2. **Sign a message**
3. **Confirm registration transaction**

📖 See: [Account Registration](account/registration.md)

### Which wallets are supported?

All EVM-compatible wallets are supported:
- MetaMask (recommended)

### How do I bridge assets?

Taolend runs on the Bittensor EVM chain, so assets must be bridged first:

**Lenders**:
1. Bridge TAO for lending
2. Bridge an additional ~0.1 TAO for Gas

**Borrowers**:
1. Bridge ALPHA as collateral
2. Bridge ~0.05–0.1 TAO for Gas

**Estimated Time**: 10–30 seconds

📖 See: [Bridge Assets](account/bridge-assets.md)

### Can I use multiple wallets?

Yes. Each wallet address is treated as a separate account:
- Assets and history are isolated
- Easy switching between accounts
- No linking required

### What if I forget my password?

Taolend does not store passwords. Your wallet controls your account.

**Important**:
- Back up your mnemonic phrase securely
- Never share your private key
- Accounts cannot be recovered by the platform

## Deposits and Withdrawals

### Is there a minimum deposit?

There is **no minimum**, but due to Gas costs:
- Lenders are advised to deposit at least 10 TAO
- Borrowers should deposit sufficient ALPHA for their loan needs

### When are deposits available?

Deposits are available immediately after confirmation (usually **10–30 seconds**):
- Lenders can create Offers right away
- Borrowers can borrow immediately

### Can I withdraw at any time?

Yes, with the following constraints:

**Lenders**:
- Withdrawable Balance = Balance − Amount currently lent

**Borrowers**:
- Withdrawable Balance = Balance − Collateral Amount

### How long do withdrawals take?

Withdrawals are processed immediately after confirmation (around **10–30 seconds**).

### Why can’t I withdraw my full Balance?

**Lenders**:
- Some TAO is actively lent out

**Borrowers**:
- ALPHA is locked as collateral

📖 See: [Deposits and Withdrawals](account/deposit-withdraw.md)

## Lend (Lender)

### How do I become a lender?

1. Bridge TAO
2. Register an account
3. Deposit TAO
4. Create a Loan Offer

📖 See: [Lend](core-features/lend.md)

### What is a Loan Offer?

A Loan Offer defines the lending terms set by a lender:
- **Amount**: Maximum TAO to lend
- **Daily APR**
- **Subnet**: Accepted ALPHA Subnet
- **Maximum Acceptable Price**: ALPHA price cap
- **Expire in**: Offer validity period

**Key Characteristics**:
- ✅ Offline signature
- ✅ Immediately visible in the Market
- ✅ Can be cancelled on-chain

### Does creating an Offer cost Gas?

No. Creating a Loan Offer uses an offline signature and is Gas-free.

### Is there a limit on Offers?

No limit. You can create as many Offers as you like.

### How do I cancel an Offer?

1. Go to **Lend → Offers / Active**
2. Click **Cancel**
3. Confirm the transaction

### How do lenders earn interest?

```
Total Interest = Borrow Amount × Daily APR × Days
Lender Earnings = Interest × 70%
Protocol Fee = Interest × 30%
```

>💡 Interest is calculated per block (1 day = 7,200 blocks). Daily APR is shown for clarity.

### When can I collect collateral?

After the **3-day minimum loan period**:
- 0–3 days: Collection not allowed
- After 3 days: Collection can be initiated
- Collection window: 3 days
- After that: Collateral may be claimed

### What happens if a borrower defaults?

If repayment is not made after the collection window:
1. Click **Claim Interest / Withdraw Collateral**
2. ALPHA collateral is transferred to you

### When is interest credited?

Interest is credited immediately after repayment and added to your Balance.

## Borrow (Borrower)

### How do I borrow?

1. Bridge ALPHA and some TAO for Gas
2. Register
3. Deposit ALPHA
4. Go to **Borrow → Assets**
5. Accept a matched Offer

📖 See: [Borrow](core-features/borrow.md)

### What is the minimum Borrow Amount?

The minimum is **1 TAO**.

### How much TAO can I borrow?

```
Borrowable TAO = ALPHA amount × ALPHA price × 60% (depends on Offer)
```

A 90% price safety margin is applied.

### Is there a fixed loan term?

No fixed maturity, but:
- Minimum loan period: 3 days
- Collection period: 3 days
- Failure to repay results in full collateral loss

### Is collection automatic after 3 days?

No. After the 3-day minimum period, lenders are allowed to initiate collection, but it is never automatic.

### Can I repay early?

Yes:
- Interest accrues only for actual usage time
- No early repayment penalties
- Collateral unlocks immediately

### What if I don’t have enough TAO to repay?

1. Go to **Profile**
2. Click **Deposit**
3. Ensure sufficient Balance before clicking **Repay Loan**

### What is refinancing?

Refinancing replaces an active loan with a better Offer:
- Automatically closes the old loan
- Opens a new one in a single transaction
- Saves Gas and reduces interest

### How do I avoid liquidation?

- Repay within 3 days
- Monitor loan status
- Maintain sufficient TAO Balance
- Refinance if rates drop

### What happens if I’m overdue?

After collection ends:
- ❌ All ALPHA collateral is lost
- ❌ Collateral is transferred to the lender
